# web_app

After much trial and error I have a web app to present. It's very simple and not real polished but the aim is to present my knowledge of SQL in pre-defined queries using a good set of fake healthcare data from a book I bought. The app allows the user to view the query, click to run it and see the results returned below. It currently has Basics, Advanced and Functions.
